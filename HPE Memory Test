#     HPE Memory Test

# ###########################################################################
#    Enabling or disabling Extended Memory Test   #


# Use the Extended Memory Test option to configure whether the system validates memory during the memory initialization process. When enabled, and uncorrectable memory errors are detected, the memory is mapped out, and the failed DIMMs are logged to the IML. 

######   Enabling this option might significantly increase boot time. 



#    Procedure

#        From the System Utilities screen, select System Configuration > BIOS/Platform Configuration (RBSU) > System Options > Boot Time Optimizations > Extended Memory Test.
#        Select a setting.

#            Enabled
#    
#            Disabled
#        Save your setting.
